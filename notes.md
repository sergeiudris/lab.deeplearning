      - in 'software&updates' select nvidia driver as active
      - create password
      - when laptop restarts, blue screen appears
      - select 'enroll MOK'
      - not sure next

    - CuDNNBatchNorm
      - caused by importing other examples into d2l app which had mxnet-linux-cpu deps instead of gpu

      - https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/4224
      - notes
        - the issue is likely caused by 4G GPU RAM being not enough
        - in general, it seems you need at least 8-10 GB
          - when training with BERT on CPU , RAM usage is ~10 GB with batch-size 32
    - docker-compose --gpus
      - https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6691
      - use docker run --gpus directly while docker-compose does not support --gpus flag

  - value
    - as guide clarifies, single threaded nature of node makes tfjs-node unequal to tf itself or mxnet

    - Execution error (DL4JInvalidInputException) at org.deeplearning4j.nn.layers.BaseLayer/preOutputWithPreNorm (BaseLayer.java:306).
      Input that is not a matrix; expected matrix (rank 2), got rank 1 array with shape [784]. Missing preprocessor or wrong input type?
